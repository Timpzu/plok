# PLOK - Enterprise software concept

As a part of innovation and project management course in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, our team of students did a project for Finnish IT service company. The assignment was to create innovation for increasing performance of B2B sales.

The solution we came up with is Plok, a software that automates the process of customising enterprise applications for needs of a company in a smooth pick and choose fashion. The innovation gained us the second place of around 40 participants in a competition held at the end of the course.
